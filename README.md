# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis-using-Python
Customer Behavior Analysis is a valuable process that empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions, enhance customer experiences, and remain competitive in a dynamic market. Below is the process we can follow for the task of Customer Behaviour Analysis:

1.Collect data related to customer interactions. It can include purchase history, website visits, social media engagement, customer feedback, and more.

2.Identify and address data inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers to ensure the dataâ€™s quality and accuracy.

3.Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation to summarize data.

4.Create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts to explore trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.

5.Use techniques like clustering to group customers based on common behaviours or characteristics.

So, the process starts with collecting data based on customer behaviour on a platform. I found an ideal dataset for this task which is given in the file section.
