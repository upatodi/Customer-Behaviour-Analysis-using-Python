# E-Commerce Customer Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes customer behavior data from an e-commerce platform using **Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Scikit-learn**.  
It demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, churn prediction, and visualization.

##  Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
   - Analyzed dataset of 500 customers with demographics, browsing, and purchase behavior.
   - Summary statistics using `pandas`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Histograms and bar plots for age, gender, and device usage.
   - Grouped analysis by gender and device type.

3. **Customer Segmentation**
   - CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) based segmentation: Low, Medium, High Value customers.
   - RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling with clustering using KMeans.

4. **Churn Analysis**
   - Defined churn (customers with 0 purchases).
   - Built a **Logistic Regression model** to predict churn probability.
   - Evaluated performance with accuracy and classification metrics.

5. **Business Insights**
   - Identified device usage patterns for purchases.
   - Suggested retention strategies for high-churn customer groups.

##  Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Plotly (interactive dashboards)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, KMeans)
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Files

- `ecommerce_customer_analysis.ipynb` → Full project notebook with code, visualizations, and results.
- `ecommerce_customer_data.csv` → Dataset (simulated).
- `README.md` → Project overview.

##  Key Learnings

- End-to-end **customer analytics pipeline** from raw data → insights → predictive modeling.
- Practical demonstration of **churn analysis, segmentation, and clustering**.
- Showcasing EDA + ML skills for **Data Analyst / Data Scientist** roles.
